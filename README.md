# Neovim configuration based on 'Neovim from Scratch'

This configuration was based on ChristianChiarulli's excellent tutorial series.

see: https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch

However, this configuration diverges from and modifies the original so much 
that it is not a mergeable fork. All work here is freely usable under GPL3.
